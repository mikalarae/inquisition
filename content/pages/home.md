This website is intended as a resource for students and researchers interested in histories of inquisitions worldwide. Though primarily focused on the Spanish inquisitions of the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries, attention is also paid to medieval inquisitions as well as to Portuguese, Roman and various New World inquisitions that existed from the sixteenth century onwards.
Thematic introductory essays present various types of documents generated by and around these religious tribunals with references given for further reading. Examples of selected documents discussed in the essays are also provided to give viewers a virtual "hands-on" experience of examining such materials in their original format. Overall the goal is to stimulate and facilitate further exploration of inquisition history by familiarizing new generations with its extremely rich yet challenging documentary legacy.
